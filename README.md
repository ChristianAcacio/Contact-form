Contact Form Project

This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a way for me to practice and improve my coding skills. It includes a simple contact form with basic validation using JavaScript.
Now that I’ve refreshed my knowledge of these foundational web technologies, I’m planning to start learning a JavaScript framework—React—which will help me build more efficient and dynamic projects in the future.
